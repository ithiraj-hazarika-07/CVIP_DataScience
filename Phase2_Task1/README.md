### (i) Transforming the dataset into suitable form to apply machine learning algorithms.
### (ii) Using Logistic Regression Model to predict whether a given mail is a spam or not.
### (iii) Using Naive Bayes Classifier (Multinominal) Model to predict whether a given mail is a spam or not.
### (iv) Accuracy of Naive Bayes Model is found to be slightly greater than that of the Logistic Regression Model.
